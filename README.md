## Summary 

  It appears that there is not any bias since the percentage of 5 star ratings is actually lower for vine reviews than for the non-vine reviews. 
An additional analysis that could help further establish certainty would be to recalculate the percentage of 5 star ratings for both types of reviews but with the condition that they are verified reviews.
